## Security Final Project

**Authors: Sophie Zhao, Maggie Song**

#### Introduction

Individuals and institutions face growing susceptibility to data breaches and unauthorized entry. Thus, there's an urgent demand for effective tools that can enhance the security of sensitive files and data management practices. In response to this critical need, we developed an application that can help users to secure their files by encrypting and decrypting a diverse range of file types including text documents, PDFs, and images. Our application also includes a comprehensive password check to ensure the password set up by the user is strong enough and thus enhance protection against unauthorized access.

#### Technologies Used
We use Python to develop this application and use libraries such as pycryptodome and PyPDF for some specific file type encryption and decryption.

#### Implementation Details
Provide a high-level overview of how your code is structured and organized. Highlight any particularly important or interesting aspects of the implementation.


#### Code Structure
Briefly describe the structure of your codebase. Highlight important directories or files and their purposes.

#### How to Run
To run this application, set up a virtual environment first and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then do `python3 main.py` to run the application.


#### Future Improvements
Discuss any potential enhancements or additional features that could be added to your project in the future.

#### Conclusion
Summarize your project and its significance. Reflect on what you learned from the experience of designing and implementing it.
