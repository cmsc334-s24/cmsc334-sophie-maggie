## Project Proposal

Our project is within the "Building a Security Enhancing Tool" area. 


**Problem to Address:**

Individuals and organizations are increasingly vulnerable to data breaches and unauthorized access. Therefore, there is a critical need for robust tools that enhance the security of sensitive files and data management practices. We plan to address this problem with the following application.


**Project Plan:**

We plan to create an application that allows users to securely store files using encryption, including txt, docs, pdf, image, video, audio, etc. 

The core functionality will enable users to encrypt and decrypt files using strong, user-defined passwords. 

Meanwhile, align with the encryption tool, we plan to introduce an integrated password manager. It will offer capabilities to securely store, generate, and retrieve passwords. Users' passwords will be evaluated based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and the use of common password pitfalls.


**Implementation:**

File Storage: Our application will incorporate file I/O (Input/Output) operations, enabling users to create, update, and read files. 

Encryption and Decryption: Our application will employ symmetric encryption techniques. Inspired by historical methods like the Enigma, we plan to adapt and evolve these strategies.

Passwords: In addition to password checks, we plan to maintain a repository of common and easily guessable passwords. Our system will cross-reference user-generated passwords against this repository to encourage the selection of stronger and more secure passwords.

Our application is currently designed to store files and passwords locally. However, as our project evolves, we are open to integrating front-end and back-end improvements that may lead to alternative storage solutions, potentially incorporating cloud-based options to enhance accessibility.
